# ONE — Reference System
### A living system for coherence under load

This repository documents a **reference system** used to explore how governance, memory, workflows, and human context interact in real AI-enabled platforms.

It exists to show the *big picture* — not to expose private implementation.

---

## 🧭 System Lens

This system is built around a single idea:

**Coherence under load** —  
A system should remain understandable, governable, and dependable as complexity, scale, and human pressure increase.

The focus is on:
- clear intent,
- explicit boundaries,
- governed workflows,
- and drift prevention over time.

---

## 🎯 Governing Intent

To help turn messy life and work inputs into:
- grounded understanding, and
- reliable artifacts,

without losing authorship, safety, or clarity as complexity grows.

---

## 🧱 High-Level Architecture

At a conceptual level, ONE is a system-of-systems:

- **Memory** — preserving and retrieving understanding over time  
- **Workflows (Autopilot)** — turning intent into artifacts through governed pipelines  
- **Ask** — querying memory in grounded, traceable ways  
- **Governance** — contracts and invariants that prevent drift  
- **Interfaces** — human entry points for intent and review

This repo documents the structure, not the code.

---

## 📐 Boundaries

In scope:
- intent and system framing
- subsystem roles
- contracts between parts
- architectural patterns

Out of scope:
- private data
- full implementations
- production configs

---

## 📊 Status

This is an **evolving reference system**.
Structure comes first. Depth follows.
