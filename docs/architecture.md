# Architecture (Reference)

This document is a bounded reference note surface.

## Intended use
- Link target from other repos
- Shared language for common structures

## Core elements (high level)
- Canonical hub: one-platform
- Supporting exhibits: pattern repos (diagnostics, workflows, skeletons)
- Contracts: promotion rules + boundaries define what is publishable
